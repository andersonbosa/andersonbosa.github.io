              I'm from Florian√≥polis, Brazil. I enjoy dancing and listening to music (even
              though I'm terrible at singing). I was a dancer for a few years. I also like
              reading about philosophy and psychology every now and then.<span

              I had some exposure to programming when I was 10, but it wasn't until I
              turned 20 that I had a significant encounter that changed my feelings about
              it and inspired me to pursue it professionally.
              <br />
              <br />
              I started my career as a software developer in 2019. Around the same time, I
              already had a clear desire to specialize in Offensive Security and Secure
              Development, and that passion remains strong.
              <br />
              <br />
              I've gained some experience in the field of offensive security, which allows
              me to approach systems from an attacker's perspective. Overall, I continue
              to seek knowledge in Software Engineering and Offensive Security to become a
              better professional in my career.
